WATERCASTLE
Inspired by the simple, industrial forms of water towers captured by renowned photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher, I envisioned this project to offer chess players greater visual freedom and imagination through minimalism.
Water towers evoke a sense of originality in a world where ornamentation is disappearing, as well as a feeling of freedom. Limited by time, I had only one day to complete this project—while visiting my cousin in the south of France, where he owns a small wood lathe. Using the turning techniques I had recently learned, I was able to create an initial wooden prototype of the chess pieces.
In the next phase, I will mold the pieces along with the board to reproduce them in colored polished concrete. The games will be played on a marquetry chessboard made of colored leather, designed in striking electric blue and orange hues.

PIPELIGHT
As part of a collaboration with Leroy Merlin on the theme of upcycling, we were given a variety of broken lamp components. In one week, our team was challenged to answer the following question:
How can we design a service for creating lamps from broken parts?
We found this challenge particularly compelling, as upcycling is rarely done in series—except through recycling or repurposing raw materials. The idea of designing a service added an extra layer of complexity that our team was eager to tackle.
Diagnosis. Upon analyzing the broken lamps, we observed that the intact and reusable parts were almost always the bases and lampshades. We decided to focus our work on these elements.
Making a choice. The aesthetic and modular nature of the ventilation pipes sold at Leroy Merlin inspired us. We realized that they provided a systematic way to connect the lampshade to the lamp base. A clamp, reinforcing the industrial aesthetic of the project, secures the lamp to a table.
Experimentation & success. We explored various compositions using all the available bases and lampshades, testing different proportions, twists, and connections. Within a single day, we created four working models, proving the efficiency of our idea.
Our proposal is to make leftover lamp parts available to customers, allowing them to design their own industrial-style lamps using a ventilation pipe, clamps, and fasteners. Additionally, Leroy Merlin employees could host workshops where customers assemble their own lamps—similar to existing DIY workshops at Leroy Merlin stores, making implementation relatively straightforward.
The final lamp assembly requires minimal technical skills, except for the electrical work, which would be handled by staff for safety reasons.

FUTURISTIC LOUNGE
Our goal was to create a living space that transcends the boundaries of daily life—a place where conversation becomes an intellectual and emotional exploration while embodying a futuristic aesthetic inspired by the Space Age. This lounge is designed to be both intriguing and inviting, encouraging profound and existential discussions in a paradoxical setting that blends warmth and futurism.
The vision.
An anonymous billionaire who made his fortune in artificial intelligence wanted to create a space that fosters deep conversations and sparks new ideas—whether alone or with friends. He envisioned a futuristic environment that reflects his field of expertise while incorporating a spiritual dimension. For him, both inner reflection and dialogue can lead to new insights.
Key design elements:
* A peaceful space where guests can relax effortlessly.

* A connection to the outdoors.

* A setting that evokes space exploration and themes of life and the universe.

Concept.
This conversation lounge, inspired by robotic and space-age technologies, is heavily influenced by the work of Hajime Sorayama. It invites idea-sharing, relaxation, and meditation, balancing metallic coldness with warm light.
Projected inside a glass dome, supported by a polished aluminum repoussé structure, a three-dimensional holographic image appears using the Pepper’s Ghost illusion technique.

PHOTON
I set myself the challenge of designing and crafting a pair of glasses from scratch, testing my craftsmanship skills through the technique of metal stamping.
Photon is an innovative fishing eyewear project, reimagined to merge functionality and minimalism. Instead of traditional arms, these glasses secure around the head with a leather strap, ensuring both comfort and stability. Their polarized lenses enhance underwater visibility, allowing for a clearer view of fish.
Still in development, Photon is a project I am determined to refine and expand beyond my studies.

TSCHUMI
Sociability is a key issue in urban planning.
How can light influence social interactions in the green spaces of La Villette, designed by Bernard Tschumi?
My project is built around three main principles:
   1. Designing a user experience that respects the architectural intent of the space.

   2. Exploring the role of light as a tool to foster sociability.

   3. Drawing inspiration from La Villette’s bold graphic forms.

The concept.
My lamp—lightweight, portable, and induction-rechargeable—reinterprets the aesthetics of the Space Age, echoing one of the defining influences that gives Parc de la Villette its graphic identity. Its halo of light creates a circle of conviviality, while multiple halos interact scenographically, offering a new perception of the park’s space.
I have presented this project to La Villette’s management and will unveil a finalized prototype by the end of the year.
Designed to encourage social interactions in the open fields of La Villette, the Tschumi luminaire is based on sociological research on urban sociability. Inspired by the park’s graphic and illustrative forms, it creates a fluid spatial experience through its halo system, shaping meeting points and gathering spaces.
Accessible through a deposit-based lending system, this modular and adaptable lighting device invites visitors to engage with the park’s landscape while enhancing its nascent nighttime appeal and collective use.
